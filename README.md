# apex-legend-website-Imitation
This is an old project which me and my teammates made in high school for learning about html and how to inspect code.
Some of them is link to the official apex legends website.
I know there is still some errors.
Hmmmm if u have any idea on fixing them pls show me your solution.
I don't use this website to do anything else other than learning purpose.
